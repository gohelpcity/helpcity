					<h2>Our Story</h2>
					<p>
						According to a survey of more than 40,000 voters in over 100
						countries, the word voted most beautiful was “Mother.”
					</p>
					<p>It goes without saying why.</p>
					<p>
						My mother (Bryan’s) was an immigrant widow and single mother for
						most of my life, and I was a witness to how vulnerable and helpless
						she was. As a boy, it made me feel angry to see her have to solicit
						help from men in the neighborhood and in the church for simple
						repairs around the house and helpless that I couldn’t do more.
					</p>
					<p>But stories like this are not unusual.</p>
					<p>
						HelpCity is a tribute to extraordinary women who deserve a break
						from time to time. We are calling all sons and daughters to join us
						in the movement of honoring the most disadvantaged single mothers
						and widows in our city.

						HelpCity is a community of passionate individuals with the audacity
						to believe we can make a difference in our small corner of the
						world. That’s why we come together every Saturday morning to roll up
						our sleeves and assist a low-income single mother or widow with
						small, laborious projects around the home.
					</p>
					<p>Afterwards, we go out to lunch to celebrate!</p>
